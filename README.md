# Description:
This repository contains solutions to various programming problems from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/vladislavsherwood/), a platform known for its coding challenges that test algorithmic and data structure skills. The solutions presented here showcase my programming proficiency and problem-solving abilities.

The problems are categorized into three folders based on their difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard.

# Approach:
A significant portion of the problems in this repository are solved using two main approaches:

**SQL:** Many challenges involving data manipulation, querying, and analysis are solved using SQL queries.

**Python:** Python scripts, often leveraging libraries like Pandas and NumPy, are employed to solve problems related to data manipulation, analysis, and algorithmic tasks. This highlights my proficiency in programming with Python and utilizing relevant libraries for efficient problem-solving.

# Continuous Improvement:
It's important to note that coding skills are continually evolving. Some of the earlier problems in this repository might have solutions that I would approach more efficiently or differently now, as my skills have developed over time. The most recent problems are likely to be the best representation of my current skill level and problem-solving approach.

# Note:
While these solutions provide working examples of solving specific problems, they might not be the only optimal solutions. Coding is an iterative process, and there can be multiple ways to solve a problem. These solutions reflect my approach to the problems based on my understanding at the time of solving them.

Feel free to provide any feedback or improvements if you come across alternative or more efficient solutions. Your insights are valuable in refining my problem-solving skills.
