# Saturday: Restaurant Data Architecture & Interactive Dashboards

## Description:
Saturday is a pet project that exemplifies a comprehensive data architecture for a restaurant business, integrating SQL, Snowflake, and Looker. This project showcases a well-designed database schema to manage and analyze various aspects of a restaurant's operations. The project emphasizes creating interactive dashboards in Looker, which provide insightful visualizations and real-time data analytics to support decision-making in the restaurant industry.

## Approach:
- **SQL Database Design**: The foundation of 'Saturday' is a robust SQL database that captures all essential elements of a restaurant's operations. This includes tables for inventory, staff, orders, customers, and more. Each table is meticulously designed to ensure data integrity and optimal performance.

- **Snowflake Integration**: Leveraging the power of the Snowflake cloud data platform, 'Saturday' offers scalable storage and computing power. Snowflake's unique architecture allows for efficient data storage and querying.

- **Looker Dashboards**: The heart of 'Saturday' lies in its interactive dashboards built using Looker. These dashboards provide real-time insights into different facets of the restaurant's operations, such as sales trends, inventory levels, staff performance, and customer preferences. The dashboards are designed to be user-friendly, offering intuitive navigation and clear visualizations to make data-driven decisions easier for restaurant managers and stakeholders.

## Features:
1. **Comprehensive Data Model**: Includes all critical areas of restaurant management like inventory tracking, order processing, staff scheduling e.t.c.

2. **Real-Time Data Analysis**: Up-to-the-minute data allows for timely insights and quick decision-making.

3. **Interactive Visualizations**: Dynamic charts, graphs, and tables that are both informative and easy to understand.

4. **User Access Control**: Secure views in Snowflake ensure that sensitive data is protected and only accessible to authorized users.

5. **Customizable Dashboards**: Looker dashboards can be customized to meet the unique needs and preferences of each user.

6. **Jupyter Notebook Storytelling**: The entire process of building the project, from database design to dashboard creation, is documented in a Jupyter Notebook. This provides a comprehensive guide for understanding the project's implementation.

## Potential Enhancements:
- Integration with online ordering systems to track and analyze delivery and take-out orders.
- Implementing AI and ML for predictive analytics in inventory and sales.
- Customer feedback analysis tools to improve service quality and menu offerings.
